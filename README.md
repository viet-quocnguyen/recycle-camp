<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Recycle Cam is an app with a built-in camera, which takes a picture of a waste item, they need characterized. The built-in AI model, built with Microsoft's Azur's Custom Vision, classifies the waste item as garbage, recycling, compost, or e-waste. It also includes a map feature which informs the user of nearby recycling stations/plants.

You could see the live demo of this project [here](https://aavasapkota.github.io/dump_it/).
